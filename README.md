## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Views** | Target variable â€“ number of views a video received |
| **Likes** | Number of likes the video gained |
| **Comments** | Number of comments on the video |
| **Shares** | Number of shares/reposts |
| **Duration (seconds)** | Length of the video |
| **Platform** | YouTube Shorts or TikTok |
| **Country / Region / Language** | Demographic info |
| **Hashtags / Title / Description** | Textual metadata |

## ðŸ§  Approach & Techniques

### 1. Business Understanding

Predict **video views** based on engagement and metadata features.  
Helps creators and marketers understand what drives video popularity and design better content strategies.  

### 2. Data Preparation

- Dropped irrelevant identifiers (video IDs).  
- Scaled numerical features like likes, comments, shares, and duration.  
- Encoded categorical features such as platform and country.  
- Cleaned text-based fields (hashtags, titles) for potential feature engineering.  

### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Engagement Ratios** (likes/views, comments/views) to normalize influence.  
- **Hashtag Encoding** to represent presence of trending tags.  
- **Duration Buckets** (short, medium, long) to capture non-linear length effects.  

### 4. Model Selection

- **Linear Regression** as a baseline.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** for capturing non-linear relationships.  
- **XGBoost Regressor** for higher accuracy and feature importance insights.  

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

```

### 5. Evaluation

- **Metrics**: RMSE and RÂ² Score  
- Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed the baseline.  
- Feature importance showed **likes, shares, and comments** as the top drivers of video views.

## ðŸ“ˆ Why These Features?

- **Likes, Comments, Shares** â†’ Strong engagement proxies.  
- **Duration** â†’ Medium-length videos often perform best.  
- **Platform** â†’ TikTok vs YouTube Shorts reward different patterns.  
- **Hashtags / Metadata** â†’ Indicate trends and discoverability.  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Use **NLP embeddings** for titles, descriptions, and hashtags.  
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** on Random Forest / XGBoost.  
- Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for creators to enter video details and get predicted views.  
- Extend dataset with **posting time** and **trending data** for more accurate predictions.
